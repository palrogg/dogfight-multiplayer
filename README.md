# Dogfight multiplayer game

This is a baby repository, I didn't figure out what to write here yet.

A multiplayer prototype using mostly already existing assets (sprites and sounds from @endless-sky, client-server model by Ruben Torres).

Server files:

* index.js (summary)

Client files:

* client.js

* ships.js

Code is GPL-licensed, sprites and sounds are CC-BY-SA. For a full list of attributions, see [copyright.txt](copyright.txt).
